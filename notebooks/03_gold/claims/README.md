# Gold Layer: Claims, Feedback & Providers

Aggregates and reshapes curated Silver data into KPI-ready tables for reporting, anomaly detection, and quality metrics. Each notebook computes focused outputs with snapshot overwrite logic for simplicity and reliability.

## Execution Pattern

All Gold tables are fully rebuilt on each run (e.g. via `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE`). This design favors clarity, supports daily refreshes, and is performant due to modest data volume.

Windowing, grouping, and join logic are localized to each notebook and aligned with the business questions driving each KPI set.
