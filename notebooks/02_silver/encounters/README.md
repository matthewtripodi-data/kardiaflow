# Silver Layer: Patients & Encounters

Transforms Bronze records into clean, queryable Silver Delta tables using CDC logic (SCDâ€‘1), PHI masking, and enrichment joins. Output is continuously updated for streaming tables and batched for patient data.

## Silver Tables

| Table Name                          | Description                                                       |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `silver_patients`                  | Latest non-PHI demographics with birth year and masked identifiers |
| `silver_encounters`                | Deduplicated, timestamped clinical events with CDF-based updates   |
| `silver_encounters_enriched`       | Streaming join of encounters with patient demographics             |

## Patients

- **Trigger**: One-shot incremental batch from Bronze CDF
- **Pattern**: Deduplicate by `_commit_version`, mask PHI fields, derive `birth_year`
- **Join Logic**: Static dimension; used for enriching encounter streams

---

## Encounters

- **Trigger**: Continuous stream (every 30 seconds) with Auto Loader + Delta CDF
- **Pattern**: Upsert via MERGE using streaming `foreachBatch`
- **Enrichment**: Left join with `silver_patients` to produce `silver_encounters_enriched`

---

## Privacy Handling

The `silver_patients` table masks sensitive fields:
- `first`, `last`, `ssn`, `drivers`, `passport`, `birthplace`

These columns are explicitly nulled at write time to prevent exposure.

## Output Format

All Silver tables are Delta Lake managed and optimized for downstream Gold KPIs, joining, and analytics. Streaming logic ensures updates are applied incrementally, with schema evolution support.
