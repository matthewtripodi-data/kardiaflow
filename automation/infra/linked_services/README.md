# KardiaFlow â€“ Azure Data Factory Linked Services

This document describes the four linked services configured in Azure Data Factory (`kardiaflow-adf`) to support the KardiaFlow ingestion pipelines. Each linked service connects to a source or target system and defines the integration runtime, authentication, and other connection properties.
