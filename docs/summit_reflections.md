## Databricks Data + AI Summit 2025: Reflections and Real-World Impact on Kardiaflow

In June 2025, I attended the Databricks Data + AI Summit in San Francisco, where
I completed 24 hours of intensive, hands-on training across six in-depth labs.
This immersive experience significantly shaped my vision and approach to the
Kardiaflow project.

The summit began with the Lakeflow Connect workshop, which provided valuable insights
into data ingestion strategies. A key takeaway was mastering Auto Loader for incremental
ingestion from various sources, including structured CSV, Avro, and Parquet formats.
This directly influenced Kardiaflow’s Bronze layer design, allowing ingestion of evolving
healthcare datasets, complete with schema evolution and auditing via `_ingest_ts`
and `_source_file` columns.

During the Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines session, I deepened my proficiency in
orchestrating automated ETL workflows. Although I ultimately opted not to implement
Declarative Pipelines or DLT-specific syntax, the principles of automated
incremental batch and streaming updates informed my approach to using PySpark and
Delta Lake features. This session reinforced the value of explicit schema definitions
in Kardiaflow’s Silver transformations, facilitating reliable Change Data Feed-based
updates and merges.

The Databricks Streaming and Lakeflow Pipelines lab further enhanced
my understanding of Spark Structured Streaming and Auto Loader, particularly regarding
state management and stream-static joins. I applied this in Kardiaflow by using `availableNow=True` for
bounded batch demos and `trigger(processingTime="30 seconds")` for continuous streaming.

The Unity Catalog session was pivotal for my approach to data governance within Kardiaflow. 
Practical training on fine-grained access controls, external storage integrations, and
lineage tracking emphasized the importance of data security practices. While Unity Catalog
itself wasn’t used in Kardiaflow, I applied its principles by enforcing PHI masking and nullification
in the Silver layer.

The Data Warehousing lab, led by Luca Gennari, enhanced my capabilities in delivering
analytics. Learning advanced dashboard creation techniques using Databricks
SQL and effective visualization of KPIs improved Kardiaflow’s Gold
layer. By producing clear, actionable analytics and well-designed dashboards, Kardiaflow
now offers robust patient lifecycle metrics and insights crucial for healthcare decision-makers.

The Lakeflow Jobs session equipped me with valuable insights into orchestration practices,
including conditional task execution, checkpointing, and error-handling strategies.
I was able to integrate this into Kardiaflow by using jobs parameters for the Encounters
pipeline, allowing easy toggling between streaming and batch ingestion modes.

Moreover, I achieved my Databricks Associate Data Engineer certification during the
summit and subsequently earned my Databricks Professional Data Engineer certification
with a 91% score, which reinforced my grasp of core Lakehouse principles.

Overall, attending the Databricks Summit provided targeted, actionable insights and
advanced data engineering methodologies, informing the design decisions behind
Kardiaflow’s architecture, particularly around streaming, validation, and privacy handling.
The experience sharpened my implementation skills and deepened my architectural judgment, 
both of which directly shaped Kardiaflow
